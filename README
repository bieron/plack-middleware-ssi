NAME
    Plack::App::File::SSI - Extension of Plack::App::File to serve SSI

DESCRIPTION
    Will try to handle HTML with server side include directives as well as
    doing what Plack::App::File does for "regular files".

SUPPORTED SSI DIRECTIVES
    See <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_include.html>,
    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/ssi.html> or
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes> for more details.

  set
        <!--#set var="SOME_VAR" value="123" -->

  echo
        <!--#echo var="SOME_VAR" -->

  exec
        <!--#exec cmd="ls -l" -->

  flastmod
        <!--#flastmod virtual="index.html" -->

  fsize
        <!--#fsize file="script.pl" -->

  include
        <!--#include virtual="relative/to/root.txt" -->
        <!--#include file="/path/to/file/on/disk.txt" -->

SUPPORTED SSI VARIABLES
  Standard variables
    DATE_GMT, DATE_LOCAL, DOCUMENT_NAME, DOCUMENT_URI, LAST_MODIFIED and
    QUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED.

  Extended by this module
    Any variable defined in Plack $env will be avaiable in the SSI document.
    Even so, it is not recommended to use any of those, since it may not be
    compatible with Apache and friends.

SYNOPSIS
    See Plack::App::File.

METHODS
  serve_path
    Will do the same as "serve_path" in Plack::App::File, unless for files
    with mimetype "text/html": Will use "serve_ssi" then.

  serve_ssi
        [$status, $headers, [$text]] = $self->serve_ssi($env, $file);

    Will parse the file and search for SSI statements.

  parse_ssi_from_filehandle
        $text = $self->parse_ssi_from_filehandle($FH, \%variables);

    Will return the content from $FH as a plain string, where all SSI
    directives are expanded. All expression which could not be expanded will
    be replaced with "[an error occurred while processing this directive]".
